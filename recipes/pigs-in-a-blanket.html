  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pigs in a blanket made with refrigerated biscuit dough and hot dogs. Kids love them! 
  If you are making these for small children, cut the hot dogs into fourths length-wise.</p>
  <p>These pigs in a blanket are perfect for parties â€” and they quickly come together with just three ingredients!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 (10 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough</li>
    <li>8 slices American processed cheese (Optional)</li>
    <li>8 frankfurters</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>

    <li>Place rolls, seam-side down, on a cookie sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
